# TVPlaylists
TVPlaylists allows users to create, edit, and share multiple TV show playlists.

This app solves a problem in the current structure of TV-related apps: users typically must conduct multiple searches in order to obtain results for a multi-dimensional query (i.e. every Christmas episode of _How I Met Your Mother_.)

iOS Software Functionalities and Technologies Used

	4. A System Action share button allowing the user to share playlists on their favorite social media, notes, and other platforms
