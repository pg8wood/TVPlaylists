# TVPlaylists
TVPlaylists allows users to create, edit, and share multiple TV show playlists.

This app solves a problem in the current structure of TV-related apps: users typically must conduct multiple searches in order to obtain results for a multi-dimensional query (i.e. every Christmas episode of _How I Met Your Mother_.)
